                    <h2>Script</h2>
                    <p>You know, life has this way of handing you moments / that just feel… unbearable.<br>
                        Like, when you waste time / you can never get back,<br>
                        or when you miss an opportunity so important / it haunts you for weeks—maybe even years.<br><br>
                        
                        It's those raw moments—the ones you can't undo—that really cut deep.<br><br>
                        
                        I mean, think about it.<br>
                        Missing out on a project / you poured your heart into,<br>
                        or losing a game / you trained for—<br>
                        it's not just about the event itself.<br><br>
                        
                        It's about the part of yourself / that was tied to it.<br>
                        It feels like it's not just a loss of time or effort—<br>
                        it's a loss of identity,<br>
                        of who you thought you were / or wanted to be.<br>
                        And yeah, that hurts. A lot.<br><br>
                        
                        You know, there's this meme I saw the other day / that sums it up perfectly:<br>
                        "I don't drink, I don't do drugs. I live with my suffering raw."<br><br>
                        
                        It's funny, in a dark, painfully relatable way.<br>
                        Because that's exactly it, right?<br><br>
                        
                        We don't always have a way to numb the pain / or distract ourselves.<br>
                        Sometimes, you just have to sit with it / as it carves deep scars<br>
                        into your ego and your sense of self.<br><br>
                        
                        But here's the thing.<br>
                        That pain—it's part of being human.<br><br>
                        
                        We all go through it / in one way or another.<br>
                        It's what it means to live, to care, / to have loves and dislikes.<br>
                        Nobody escapes unscathed.<br><br>
                        
                        And maybe, in a strange way, that's comforting.<br>
                        It's like, yeah, this hurts,<br>
                        but it's also what connects us all.<br><br>
                        
                        This shared experience of loss, of raw pain, / reminds me that I'm not alone in this.</p>
